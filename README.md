# Violence Detection in Videos

This project implements a real-time violence detection system using MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture. The system analyzes video frames and classifies content as either "Violence" or "Non-Violence" with high accuracy.

## Overview

The violence detection system works by:

1. Extracting frames from videos
2. Processing frames through a trained MobileNetV2 model
3. Classifying each frame as violent or non-violent
4. Providing real-time visual feedback on processed videos

## Data Collection

The data used was data provided by Kaggle. The data is largely divided into Violence and NonViolence for 1000 images each.

## Model

MobileNetV2 is used to with improved accuracy and predictions. It was chosen in order to be deployed for Raspberry Pi and Android.

## How to Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 2.10.0
- OpenCV 4.6.0
- NumPy 1.26.4
- Pandas 2.2.3
- Matplotlib 3.10.0
- scikit-learn 1.6.1
- scikit-image 0.24.0
- imgaug 0.4.0
- imutils 0.5.4
- CUDA Toolkit 11.2 with cuDNN 8.1.0 (for GPU acceleration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/violence-detection.git
cd violence-detection

# Option 1: Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: Using conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate CCDEPLRL_PROJECT
```

### Data Preparation

1. Place violence and non-violence videos in the kaggle dataset in their respective directories under `video/`
2. Run the frame extraction Jupyter Notebook

### Training the Model

1. Run the mobilenetv2 Jupyter Notebook

### Processing Videos

1. Place videos to be analyzed in the `input/` directory
2. Run the prediction script:
3. Run the frame extraction Jupyter Notebook
4. Processed videos will be saved in the `output/` directory

## Model Architecture

The system uses MobileNetV2 with the following modifications:

- Input shape: 128x128x3 (Also change the predict_video image size to match the model)
- Global Average Pooling
- Dropout (0.4) for regularization
- Dense output layer with sigmoid activation
- L2 regularization (0.0005)
- Binary cross-entropy loss function
- Adam optimizer with dynamic learning rate

## Performance Optimization

- Resizing image from 128 to 224/256 (Also change the predict_video image size to match the model)
- Batch size can be increased from 32 to 64/128 (speeds up epoch)
- Change the alpha parameter from 0.75 to 1.0 (to utilize full model)
- Change the layer.trainable from false to true (to help fine tuning the model)
- Utilize the full dataset from 10000 to all the extracted frames (more date better generalization)
- Increase patience from 5 to 10-20 (better converge)
- Increase epoch from 50 to between 50-100 (better converge)
